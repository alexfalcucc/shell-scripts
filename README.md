Trevor's personal device settings

# Workflow

- Use only desktop for work items _(remove work items like email/Slack from mobile devices)_
- Minimal single tasking _(complete tasks one at a time, while only keeping open apps/windows/tabs which are currently in use)_
- Use spotlight to open/switch between apps and keyboard shortcuts inside apps
- Once a day, run `script-synchronize` to stay up-to-date/organized
- A few times a day, check messages (texts, email, Slack) and add/update tasks as needed
